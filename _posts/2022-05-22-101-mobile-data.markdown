### Introduction
The main goal of this post is to describe the steps to discover and use a mobile app API (own or third party).

I divided the problem in the following steps, each of it will be future blog entries: 

1. **API Discovering**: Find the request made from a mobile app.

    `1.1 Problem ` How do I capture the app API requests?\
    `1.1 Solution` Use a data-network packet analyzer
    
    `1.2 Problema` OK, I can see the requests but the are encrypted ...\
    `1.2 Solución` Man in the middle with custom certificates. Only on iOS.
        
2. **API Authentication**: Is OK to know how to make the APIs calls, but they are useless if we don´t know how to emulate them. We need to discover how the app authenticate through the server.
    
    `2.1 Problem ` How do I find the authentication data?\
    `2.1 Solution` Reverse engineering: Use Mobile app (.apk) decompiler.
    
    `2.2 Problem ` I can't read the code.\
    `2.2 Solution` How to follow the decompiled methods and variables.

3. **Use the API**

    Once we know how to make and authenticate the API requests, we only need to try.
